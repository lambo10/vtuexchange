Minimum funding on our site is N100, while for resellers it is N2000. Furthermore, you understand that wallet funding through the cash transfer/cash deposition option is not instant, however wallet funding through dedicated wallet account is instant; though it is subject to the status of the service provider at the time of the transaction. You should also understand that all monies deposited cannot be reversed, but can be transferred from one user to another.
